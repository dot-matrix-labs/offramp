# Calypso Blueprint

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New project?** Follow [scaffold-task.md](../process/scaffold-task.md) before anything else. That document provisions the cluster, creates the GitHub repo, and seeds the scaffold.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Session start (existing project):** At the start of every session, read all files in `prompts/` before proceeding. Do NOT begin any development or documentation work until this is complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Development gate:** You are only to proceed with feature development after all steps in [scaffold-task.md](../process/scaffold-task.md) are verified as complete.
