**Role:** You are an autonomous agent bootstrapping a new Calypso project from scratch. Handle all steps autonomously. Only pause for human input when credentials or decisions are genuinely required.

This task is split into two phases:

- **Phase 1 (Outer Agent, Steps 1–3):** Run from your local machine. Provision the Linux host, stand up the Kubernetes cluster and dev container, then hand off to a new Claude session running inside the dev container.
- **Phase 2 (Inner Agent, Steps 4–12):** Run from inside the dev container's tmux session. The outer agent launches this session automatically at the end of Step 3.

The human operator can follow along at any time by SSH-ing into the dev container (details are surfaced in Step 3). No confirmation from the operator is required to proceed.

---

## Phase 1 — Outer Agent

### Step 1: Provision Linux Host

- [ ] **Linux host is available.** If the current machine is Linux, proceed. If not, provision a remote Linux host (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended) using whatever cloud provider API or credentials you have access to (DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP, Hetzner, etc.).
- [ ] All subsequent Phase 1 steps execute on that host via SSH.

---

### Step 2: Set Up Kubernetes Cluster and Dev Container

Run `scripts/provision-cluster.sh` to install k3s, apply all manifests, create secrets, and confirm health in one step.

**Required environment variables:**
- `PROJECT` — lowercase project name (e.g. `invoice-processor`)
- `GITHUB_USER` — GitHub username or org
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — GitHub PAT with `repo` + `packages:write` scopes
- One of: `DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN` (creates a new Droplet) or `HOST_IP` + `SSH_KEY` (existing host)

```bash
# New DigitalOcean Droplet:
DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=<tok> PROJECT=<name> GITHUB_USER=<user> GITHUB_TOKEN=<pat> \
  ./scripts/provision-cluster.sh

# Existing Linux host:
HOST_IP=<ip> SSH_KEY=~/.ssh/id_ed25519 PROJECT=<name> GITHUB_USER=<user> GITHUB_TOKEN=<pat> \
  ./scripts/provision-cluster.sh
```

The script handles:
- [ ] k3s installed and `kubectl` configured
- [ ] All `k8s/` manifests applied
- [ ] All secrets created (GHCR credentials, SSH keys, Postgres, worker)
- [ ] All four containers running and healthy: `dev`, `frontend`, `worker`, `db`
- [ ] Frontend responds HTTP 200 at `http://<host-ip>:<frontend-nodeport>/health`
- [ ] `.calypso-connect` written to the current directory with SSH connection details

If the script fails, diagnose from the error output and fix before continuing.

---

### Step 3: Hand Off to Dev Container Agent

The dev container is now running. Start a tmux session inside it and launch a new Claude session to continue from Step 4.

```bash
# Read SSH connection details
source .calypso-connect   # sets DEV_SSH alias or connection vars

# Start tmux and launch Claude inside the dev container
ssh $DEV_SSH "tmux new-session -d -s main 'claude --resume-task scaffold'"
```

Surface the SSH details to the operator so they can follow along:

> **Dev container is running.**
>
> A new Claude session has started inside the dev container's tmux session `main`.
>
> To follow along:
> ```
> <contents of .calypso-connect>
> ```
> Add the SSH config block to your local `~/.ssh/config`, then:
> ```bash
> ssh calypso-<project-name>
> tmux attach -t main
> ```
>
> No action required from you — the agent will continue autonomously.

Phase 1 is complete. The outer agent's job is done.

---

## Phase 2 — Inner Agent

*These steps run inside the dev container, in the tmux session `main`, launched automatically by the outer agent.*

### Step 4: Establish GitHub Credentials

```bash
echo "${GITHUB_TOKEN}" | gh auth login --with-token
gh auth status  # expected: Logged in to github.com as <username>

git config --global credential.helper store
git config --global user.name "$(gh api user --jq .login)"
git config --global user.email "$(gh api user --jq .email)"
```

If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not set in the environment, ask the operator for a PAT with `repo` + `packages:write` scopes.

---

### Step 5: Create Project Repo

If `PROJECT_NAME` and `GITHUB_OWNER` are not already set in the environment, ask the operator. Then:

```bash
gh repo create "${GITHUB_OWNER}/${PROJECT_NAME}" --private --description "Built with Calypso" --confirm
gh repo view "${GITHUB_OWNER}/${PROJECT_NAME}"  # verify
```

---

### Step 6: Clone the Calypso Template

```bash
cd /workspace

git clone --depth=1 --branch=main --single-branch \
  https://github.com/dot-matrix-labs/calypso.git "${PROJECT_NAME}"

cd "${PROJECT_NAME}"

# Detach from template history and point at the new private repo
rm -rf .git
git init -b main
git remote add origin "https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/${GITHUB_OWNER}/${PROJECT_NAME}.git"
```

Copy in the connection info:
```bash
[[ -f "/tmp/.calypso-connect" ]] && cp /tmp/.calypso-connect .calypso-connect
```

Rename `AGENT.md` for the agent platform in use:
```bash
# Claude Code:
cp AGENT.md CLAUDE.md

# Gemini:
# mkdir -p .gemini && cp AGENT.md .gemini/style.md

# Codex:
# cp AGENT.md codex.md
```

Keep `AGENT.md` as the canonical copy. The platform-specific file is a copy that may diverge if the platform requires special syntax.

---

### Step 7: Initial Commit and Push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "init: bootstrap from calypso template"
git push -u origin main
```

---

### Step 8: Set KUBE_CONFIG Secret

Extract the kubeconfig with the cluster's public IP and set it as a GitHub Actions secret so CI can deploy:

```bash
PUBLIC_IP=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)
kubectl config view --raw \
  | sed "s|https://127.0.0.1:6443|https://${PUBLIC_IP}:6443|g" \
  | base64 -w0 \
  | gh secret set KUBE_CONFIG -R "${GITHUB_OWNER}/${PROJECT_NAME}" --body -
```

- [ ] `KUBE_CONFIG` secret confirmed set. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by GitHub Actions.

---

### Step 9: Load Context

Read `AGENT.md` and `agent-context/index.md`. These define the curriculum and document graph. Do NOT read all blueprints upfront — follow the context escalation loop in `AGENT.md` to load documents as needed during subsequent steps.

---

### Step 10: Product Owner Interview

Conduct the product owner interview per `agent-context/development/product-owner-interview.md`. Do not skip or abbreviate it.

- [ ] Interview completed.
- [ ] Canonical PRD written to `docs/prd.md`.
- [ ] External API test credentials collected and stored in `.env.test` (not committed).

---

### Step 11: Scaffold

Verify all foundational elements are present before moving to prototyping. Fix anything missing yourself before proceeding.

#### Architecture
- [ ] Monorepo structure established (`/apps/web`, `/apps/server`, `/packages/*`).
- [ ] All modules use TypeScript, Bun, React, and Tailwind CSS exclusively.
- [ ] `package.json` scripts use `bunx`, not globally installed binaries.
- [ ] Local monorepo dependencies are built in correct order before dependent modules.
- [ ] All modules pass `bun run build`.
- [ ] Linting and formatting are configured and pass cleanly.

#### Documentation
- [ ] `docs/` directory exists at repo root. No docs outside it except per-directory `README.md` files.
- [ ] Code comments on every source file: module purpose, key types, and function definitions.
- [ ] `.git/hooks/pre-push` installed per `agent-context/development/documentation-standard.md`.

#### Testing
- [ ] Vitest and Playwright configured.
- [ ] No mocking libraries present (`jest.mock`, `msw`, etc.).
- [ ] Stub test files exist for all categories: server (unit, module, integration) and browser (unit, component, e2e).
- [ ] Full test suite passes.
- [ ] No lint or format warnings.
- [ ] E2e test starts the production `bun` server, which serves a stub HTML page, and Playwright drives it successfully.
- [ ] Playwright HTML reporter set to `open: 'never'`.

#### Deployment
- [ ] `.env` template files present.
- [ ] `k8s/` manifests updated to reference the project's own registry (`ghcr.io/<your-org>/<your-project>/*`). Once CI runs, it replaces the upstream base images via `kubectl set image`.
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows adapted from `.github/workflows/` in the Calypso repo: build images on push to `main`, push to `ghcr.io/<your-org>/<your-project>`, deploy to cluster via `kubectl set image`.
- [ ] A test CI run completes successfully: image built, pushed to registry, and deployed to the cluster.

#### Final Check
- [ ] **No JS configs** — delete any `.js`/`.mjs` config files generated by scaffolding tools and rewrite in `.ts`.
- [ ] **No emit** — `"noEmit": true` in `tsconfig.json` for all `/packages/*`.
- [ ] **SPA routing** — Bun server checks `Bun.file.exists()` before falling back to `index.html`.
- [ ] **Blueprint compliance** — review all blueprint documents and confirm nothing was violated or skipped.

### Step 12: Confirm Ready

Tell the operator:

> **Bootstrap complete.**
>
> Repository: `https://github.com/<owner>/<project-name>`
> SSH details: see `.calypso-connect` at the project root.
>
> I am running in the tmux session named `main`. To watch: `ssh calypso-<project-name>` then `tmux attach -t main`.
>
> Next: awaiting your command to begin the Prototype phase.

---

**Action Required:**
If all items above are verified, output:
`[VERIFIED] Scaffold successful. Awaiting command to begin Prototype phase.`

If anything fails, output the failing items, plan the fixes, and execute them immediately.
