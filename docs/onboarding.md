# Offramp - Onboarding Experience

## Discovery — How They Find Us

CIOs don't browse Product Hunt. They learn from three channels:

### Pain-Driven Search

A SaaS renewal is up 20% year-over-year. A vendor just got acquired and the roadmap is dead. A compliance audit reveals data sovereignty gaps. The CIO is googling something like "alternative to [vendor]" or "build vs buy AI." Offramp should be in that search path.

### Peer Signal

Another CIO at a dinner or Slack group says "we replaced [tool] with something our agents built and it costs us 90% less." This is the strongest channel. Every successful Offramp deployment is a referral engine.

### Provocation Content

Case studies with specific, falsifiable claims. Not thought leadership — receipts.

Example: *"We replaced a $340K/year project management SaaS with agent-built software running on $2,800/month of infrastructure."*

The content should be auditable. Show the before/after bills. Show the repo commit history. Show the timeline. CIOs trust evidence, not prose.

## First Touch — The Sequenced Experience

### Step 1: The SaaS Audit (Free)

The CIO provides their SaaS spend — a CSV from their procurement tool, a screenshot of their vendor list, or just a typed list. Offramp agents analyze it and return a report:

- Which tools are replacement candidates and why
- Estimated infrastructure cost of a replacement for each
- Complexity rating (simple CRUD app vs. deep integration nightmare)
- A recommended first target — the easiest win with the highest savings
- Honest "keep renting" recommendations for tools that aren't worth replacing

This is free. It costs us a few dollars in agent compute. It delivers value even if they never engage further. And it demonstrates the core thesis — agents just did useful work for you, instantly, for almost nothing.

**Turnaround: minutes, not weeks.**

### Step 2: The 48-Hour Prototype (Paid, Fixed Fee)

The audit identifies a target. Offramp builds a working prototype replacement in 48 hours:

- A running application, not a mockup
- Deployed to infrastructure the customer owns
- Their branding, their data model, their workflows
- Source code in a repo they control

The customer keeps the prototype regardless of whether they continue with Offramp. There is no clawback.

**This is the proof point.** The CIO can show their team: "This exists now. Agents built it over a weekend. It's running on our servers. We own the code."

### Step 3: Production Engagement (DIY or Not-SaaS)

If the prototype validates the thesis, the customer chooses their delivery model:

- **DIY**: Take the Offramp prompt management system and methodology. Run the synthetic software house internally.
- **Not-SaaS**: Offramp provisions the full stack — agents, servers, repos, storage — with pass-through billing. No markup. Full ownership.

Either way, the transition from prototype to production is incremental. The prototype isn't thrown away — it's the starting commit.

## What Makes the First Touch Delightful

### Speed

The audit comes back in minutes. The prototype ships in 48 hours. Every other vendor they've talked to wants a 6-week discovery phase and a statement of work. We show up with working software.

### Specificity

Everything is about their stack, their spend, their org. Agents can tailor output to customer context almost for free. Nothing is generic.

### Ownership

From minute one, they can see the code, access the repo, SSH into the server. Nothing is behind a curtain. This is the opposite of every SaaS onboarding they've ever experienced.

### No Commitment

The audit is free. The prototype is a fixed fee. No annual contract. No "talk to sales first." No demo request form. No 14-day trial with a credit card.

## Promises We Can Make and Keep

These must be bulletproof. Broken promises at the CIO level are career-ending for whoever championed the vendor.

### You own the code, day one

It's in their repo from the first commit. Verifiable at any time.

### Pass-through billing, no markup on infrastructure

We show them the cloud bill directly. Auditable.

### If you leave, you take everything

There is nothing proprietary in the stack. It's their servers, their repos, their data. Walking away is a non-event.

### We'll show you working software before you commit

The 48-hour prototype is scoped, concrete, and delivered before any ongoing engagement begins.

### We'll tell you when a SaaS tool is NOT worth replacing

The audit framework includes honest "keep renting" recommendations. Credibility comes from saying no. The fastest way to earn trust is to leave money on the table when the math doesn't work.

### The Meta-Promise

**We are structurally incapable of locking you in.** That's the brand. That's the opposite of every software vendor they've ever worked with. The business model only works if customers stay because the arrangement is good — not because leaving is hard.
