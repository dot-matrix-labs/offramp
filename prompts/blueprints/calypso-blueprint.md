# Calypso Blueprint

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Agent Development Gate:** You are only to proceed with feature development after all steps in [scaffold-task.md](../process/scaffold-task.md) are verified as complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bootstrap Requirement:** At the start of every session, run:
> ```
> curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dot-matrix-labs/calypso/main/scripts/bootstrap-standards.sh | bash
> ```
> Then read all files in `./docs/standards/` before proceeding. Do NOT begin any development or documentation work until this is complete.
