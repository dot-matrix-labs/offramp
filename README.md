# Offramp

Offramp enables organizations to answer a critical strategic question: **Can we replace our SaaS vendors with in-house software now that AI agents are approaching AGI-level capability?**

## Vision

The answer is sometimes yes. Offramp provides the methodology, architecture, and deployment process to make it happen.

## What is Offramp?

Offramp is a framework for running a **synthetic software house** — a team of forward-deployed AI agents that operate as an internal software development organization, purpose-built to replace SaaS vendors one product at a time.

## Core Pillars

### 1. Prompt Management Methodology
A structured approach to defining, versioning, and refining the prompts that drive agent behavior across the software lifecycle.

### 2. Software Architecture
A reference architecture for the software that agents produce, optimized for maintainability, incremental migration, and data ownership.

### 3. Continuous Deployment Process
An end-to-end pipeline for agents to ship software continuously with automated build, test, and deploy workflows.

## Delivery Models

### DIY — Prompt Management System
For organizations with existing engineering teams who want to run the synthetic software house themselves. Offramp provides the prompt management system, reference architectures, and documentation.

### Not-SaaS — Managed Infrastructure, No Markup
For organizations that want the outcome without assembling the machinery. Offramp provides the full operational stack with pass-through billing — you pay actual costs with no markup.
