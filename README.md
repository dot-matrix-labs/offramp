# Calypso

A method, git-native tools, and a TypeScript reference implementation for building **supergreen** software:

- **Fused AI** — one AI over coherent, owned data
- **Tree-shaken** — distill the 5% of features you actually use across your SaaS vendors into one seamless app
- **Correct by construction** — every line verified, maximal control over the bytes, DIY over buy
- **Self-improving** — the agent has access to live logs and telemetry, is never idle, and enters hardening mode when there is nothing left to build

---

## Quickstart

Paste into your AI agent (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, etc.):

```
Agent, bootstrap a new Calypso project.

First, run:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dot-matrix-labs/calypso/main/scripts/bootstrap-standards.sh | bash

Then read docs/standards/calypso-blueprint.md before doing anything else.

Context: I am replacing GitHub Projects for a software team of 3.
```

## The Vision

Since 2025, a solo operator can produce applications that would have taken a 20-person engineering team two years to ship. That is not an exaggeration — it is the current state of the art. AI lets every fruit stand build NASA-quality software, if you let it.

From 2026, we can go further. Super apps that leave behind the constraints of the human development cycle entirely — continuously verified, continuously improved, never idle.

**To get there, you need to go supergreen.** Orchestrating your existing SaaS stack with AI wrappers is a local maximum. You are routing around the constraints of software that was never designed for this environment.

There is a deeper problem with the fragmented SaaS model: *N* smart AIs across *N* vendor data silos will always produce worse outcomes than a single AI — even a less capable one — over fused, coherent data. You cannot reason well across data you do not hold. Fragmentation is a fundamental cap on every AI-assisted decision your organization can make.

This vision has always required superhuman implementation capacity. We have arrived at the moment that exists.

**Supergreen:**

- **Fused AI** — one AI over coherent, owned data
- **Tree-shaken** — distill the 5% of features you actually use across your SaaS vendors into one seamless app
- **Correct by construction** — every line verified, maximal control over the bytes, DIY over buy
- **Self-improving** — the agent has access to live logs and telemetry, is never idle, and enters hardening mode when there is nothing left to build

## The Blueprint

Calypso is opinionated. Several choices are counter-intuitive coming from a human development culture — they make full sense once humans are out of the development loop.

**Process** — The agent operates as a self-advancing state machine. Each commit updates the implementation plan and writes the next prompt. The agent is never waiting for human input between tasks. When there is nothing left to build, it enters hardening mode.

**Testing** — Never mock. Not APIs, not the database, not the DOM. Humans mock because writing the real thing takes time they do not have. Agents do not have that constraint. Mocks hide bugs; real fixtures catch them. All browser tests run in headless Chromium — agents have no display server, and neither should the test suite.

**Dependencies** — DIY over buy. Humans import libraries to avoid writing code. Agents write the code directly, perfectly tree-shaken to the exact behavior needed, with no transitive dependency surface to audit or upgrade. Buy only when the domain is genuinely specialized (cryptography, payment SDKs, compliance-critical integrations).

**Data** — No ORMs. Agents write SQL directly with no cognitive overhead. ORMs exist to make databases approachable for humans; they abstract away performance and generate massive footprint. The agent does not need the abstraction. Start with SQLite, graduate to PostgreSQL.

**UX** — Beauty is a gate condition, not a preference. An ugly early version sets an anchor that is nearly impossible to reverse. The AI agent is a first-class user of every application it builds: it interacts through typed APIs, not through browser automation or interfaces designed for human perception. Admin is also a first-class user — never through raw database tooling or developer consoles.

**Security** — The threat model is not "prevent breaches." It is "make a breach useless." Greenfield applications have no brownfield trade-offs to honor, so there is no excuse for anything less than banking-grade authorization, HIPAA-grade privacy, and adversarial hardening from day one.

**Deployment** — Bare metal Linux, systemd, no Docker. Docker solves environment consistency for human teams working across machines. Agents run on a known Linux host; the abstraction layer adds complexity with no benefit.

## Reference Implementation

Before making a giant leap, we start with familiar tooling. The supergreen principles can be applied today with the stack you already know.

**Calypso TS** — TypeScript reference implementation:

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript only |
| Runtime | Bun |
| UI | React + Tailwind CSS |
| Testing | Vitest (unit) + Playwright (headless E2E) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Database | SQLite → PostgreSQL |
| Auth | Self-hosted JWT (HTTP-only cookies) |
| Deploy | Bare metal Linux, systemd |

No Docker. No ORMs. No SaaS auth vendors. No mocks in tests.

**Calypso RS** — the next level: a minimalist Rust stack end-to-end, with a fully WASM client for state management and DOM rendering. No React.
